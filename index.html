  <div class="entry-content"><p>I stumbled upon Christopher Ellis&#8217; <a href="https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship">&ldquo;World Citizenship&rdquo; Blockchain ID</a> concept and was immediately intrigued. His idea is to create proof of an individual&rsquo;s existence by storing their PGP identity in the blockchain.</p>

<p>The trick is that the blockchain acts as an immutable database that includes full history tracking, meaning that a record can be proven to exist in some state at some time. These services are similar to this concept:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.proofofexistence.com/about">Proof of Existence</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cryptograffiti.info/">Cryptograffiti</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.btproof.com/">BTProof</a></li>
</ul>


<p>This post will detail how to create a Blockchain Identity.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To begin, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>GPG key with signing abilities</li>
<li>Bitcoin wallet with a small balance</li>
<li>Keybase.io account</li>
</ul>


<p>Keybase.io is currently alpha, and you need an invite to get an account, but you can probably snag an invite from Reddit (that&rsquo;s where I got mine).</p>

<p>I will be using Debian Linux for this tutorial. I recommend the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>gpg : For signing files</li>
<li>electrum : For managing bitcoins</li>
<li>ruby : For running the scripts below</li>
</ul>


<p>First you need to create a GPG key and an Electrum Bitcoin wallet. I won&rsquo;t dive into the details of how to create these in this post. The reason we are using Electrum is because it has the ability to choose the address to send funds from, unlike some other wallets. We will need to know this sending address later.</p>

<p>You also need to get a small amount of Bitcoin into your Electrum wallet (at least 0.0003 BTC)</p>

<h2>Gathering the Data</h2>

<p>Time to collect the data. Open up a text editor and create a Yaml file named key.yml</p>

<p>First, lets get the GPG key details. Run the following, substituting your UID:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --fingerprint jrruethe
pub   4096R/40B935FE 2014-06-14 [expires: 2015-06-14]
      Key fingerprint = 4F40 99F8 276B DBA5 475A  8446 4630 BEDC 40B9 35FE
uid                  Joseph Ruether &lt;jrruethe@gmail.com&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Fill out your key.yml file like so:</p>

<pre><code>Name: Joseph Ruether
Email: jrruethe@gmail.com
Type: RSA
Size: 4096
Created: 2014-06-14
Fingerprint: 4F40 99F8 276B DBA5 475A 8446 4630 BEDC 40B9 35FE
</code></pre>

<p>Next, go to your Electrum wallet and pick an address that contains a small amount of funds. You will need at least 0.0003 BTC. Add this address to your yaml file:</p>

<pre><code>Address: 1LXWthRW8aqQSBddifWxwTDGPycT6Lom2Q
</code></pre>

<p>Go to <a href="https://blockchain.info">Blockchain.info</a> and find the latest block that has been added to the main chain. Add the block number and Merkle Root to your yaml file:</p>

<pre><code>Block: 345546
Merkle Root: ea31869aa04e3608450b45068b257ee396a6d2f6724f96593cd8d2c7f30a39d9
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, your yaml file has all of your GPG key metadata, the address you will use to store the data in the blockchain, and a random number that proves this entry could not have been created earlier in time.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Data</h2>

<p>Now we need to put this data into a standard, machine readable format and sign it. First, use the following script to convert your yaml file into a normalized json file:</p>

<p>Run it like so:</p>

<pre><code>./yaml-to-normalized-json.rb key.yml &gt; key.json

<p>Then use GPG to clearsign this file:</p>

<pre><code>gpg --clearsign key.json
</code></pre>

<h2>Sending the Data to the Blockchain</h2>

<p>Now that we have our signed data file, we want to send it to the blockchain. It is important to note that the blockchain will only contain the sha256 hash of your key.json.asc, therefore you need to keep the original data around for validation. Later on, we will create an identification card with a QR code containing the original data.</p>

<p>There is a clever trick we are going to use. If you look at the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_Bitcoin_addresses">Technical Background of Bitcoin Addresses</a>, you will see that the address is generated from the hash of the public key. We can replace that hash (at step 3) with the hash of our file before continuing to generate the address. By sending Bitcoins to the address we create, we store the file&rsquo;s hash in the blockchain. Of course, those coins will be lost forever, because the private key for that address does not exist. That is why we only send a small amount.</p>

<p>Now, use the following script to obtain the Bitcoin address that is associated with the hash of your signed key.json:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Digital cryptography is used everywhere on your computer, both online and offline, to keep your secrets safe.
This is a simplified explanation of how cryptography accomplishes this task.</p>

<p>The three fundamental building blocks to modern cryptography are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Symmetric Encryption</li>
<li>Asymmetric Encryption</li>
<li>Hashes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Symmetric Encryption</h2>

<p>Symmetric encryption is the most intuitive form of encryption. The basic analogy is a lock and key. Keys are used together with an encryption algorithm to encrypt, or lock, a file. The resulting file is unreadable, and indistinguishable from random garbage data.</p>

<p>A key is just a long string of bits. Passwords supplied by a user are either used as a key directly, or are used to derive a key. With symmetric encryption, the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt a file.</p>

<blockquote><p>All data is represented in binary, a string of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s. Data alone is meaningless without structure; it all depends on how you interpret it. For example, the number <code>65</code> in binary can be represented like this: <code>01000001</code>, but if you interpret that value using the ASCII system, it becomes the letter <code>A</code>. The text <code>Hi</code> is encoded in ASCII as <code>0100100001101001</code>. If it were interpreted as two 8 bit numbers, it would be <code>(72, 105)</code>. If it were interpreted as one large number, it would be <code>18537</code>. Entire files containing text can also be interpreted as one very large number.</p></blockquote>

<p>An example of a symmetric encryption algorithm is AES: Advanced Encryption Standard. It is certified by the US government to secure secret documents.</p>

<p>Here is how symmetric encryption is performed via the GPG program on Linux, using a password of &lsquo;ABC&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>echo This is a secret | gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric | base64

jA0ECQMCjJkl5YwkaXFg0kQBjrmXBnt3sajSix4eihU/l+273UBtRabS7LFZ7Ln3R8ux0wzU
bm9IZUuAunUNnF2RYG3HC2qa7bNtlefb/Hbp+xtYjw==
</code></pre>

<p>To decrypt, simply repeat the same command, but backwards, using the same password of &lsquo;ABC&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>echo jA0ECQMCjJkl5YwkaXFg0kQBjrmXBnt3sajSix4eihU/l+273UBtRabS7LFZ7Ln3R8ux0wzU\
bm9IZUuAunUNnF2RYG3HC2qa7bNtlefb/Hbp+xtYjw== | base64 -d | gpg --cipher-algo AES256

gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
This is a secret
</code></pre>

<p>Symmetric encryption algorithms are fast and secure, even with a relatively small key size (128 &ndash; 256 bits). For this reason, they play an important role in secure communications. Their downfall, however, is key distribution; they are prone to a man-in-the-middle attack unless the keys are distributed on a separate medium.</p>

<h2>Man in the Middle attacks</h2>

<p>A man in the middle attack occurs when someone is intercepting your communication line by placing themselves inbetween you and the other person. This is different than just sniffing or evesdropping, because an attacker is able to tamper with the communication line without either party knowing. For example, if Eve was performing a man in the middle attack on a conversation between Alice and Bob, Eve would be able to impersonate Bob from Alice&rsquo;s point of view, and impersonate Alice from Bob&rsquo;s point of view. Neither Alice nor Bob would be aware that they are talking to Eve instead of the other person. Eve can effectively lie to both parties.</p>

<p>To combat this attack, encryption can be used. If Alice and Bob had the same key, they could communicate securely by encrypting their messages before sending them to the other, and decrypting them upon receipt. This prevents Eve from reading the actual message. However, in order to communicate, they need to have the same key. Either Alice or Bob can generate the key, but the difficulty is transferring the key to the other without Eve intercepting it. The only secure solution is for them to pre-share the key across some other medium, such as a phone call or in person. This exchange is cumbersome, as it must be done before each session. In addition, the key cannot be reused across different sessions; If Eve were to ever obtain the key to a single session, she could also infiltrate all the other sessions, including recordings of past sessions.</p>

<h2>Asymmetric Encryption</h2>

<p>Asymmetric encryption is different from symmetric encryption in that it utilizes two keys; one key performs the encryption while the other performs the decryption. The key that performs the encryption cannot be used to perform the decryption; the paired key must be used. It is important to note that either key can perform the encryption step, and the other key will undo it.</p>

<p>This behavior has some very useful implications. One of the keys can be selected to be the <code>private</code> key, which must be kept secure such that no one else knows it. The remaining key will become the <code>public</code> key, which can be posted online, sent to others, etc. This method is known as <code>public key cryptography</code>, and it solves the key distribution problem encountered with symmetric encryption.</p>

<p>Alice will generate a key-pair and keep the private key to herself, while sending her public key to Bob. Likewise, Bob will generate his key-pair and send his public key to Alice while keeping his private key to himself. When Alice wants to talk to Bob, she can use Bob&rsquo;s public key to perform the encryption. Only Bob will be able to decrypt the message, since he is the only one who has the private key. Bob can then respond to Alice by using her public key to encrypt his response.</p>

<p>Asymmetric encryption algorithms, such as RSA, are slow and require much larger keys to achieve the same security that AES provides (2048 &ndash; 4096 bits). This means that using asymmetric encryption for an entire conversation is inefficient. For this reason, a hybrid approach is used. A user will generate a random symmetirc key intended for one time use, called a session key, and encrypt it using the public asymmetric key of the recipient. The receiver will use their private asymmetric key to obtain the symmetric session key. Now that both users have the same symmetric key, they can use symmetric encryption to communicate.</p>

<p>But how does Bob know that the key actually came from Alice? What if Eve was the one who actually sent him the session key? Afterall, Bob&rsquo;s public key is public; anyone can use it. We need to introduce the 3rd fundamental technology first.</p>

<h2>Hashes</h2>

<p>Unlike the other two, a hash is not an encryption method. Hashes are also known as message digests or fingerprints. They are one-way functions, meaning that they cannot be reversed or undone; given the output, it is impossible to derive the input.</p>

<p>Any two messages that contain the exact same data will produce the exact same hash, or fingerprint. Similarly, if even a single bit is different, the hash will be completely different. Hash algorithms employ an avalanche technique such that a small change to the input produces a large change in the output. Finally, hash algorithms always produce the same size output regardless of the size of the input.</p>

<p>Here are some examples, using the SHA-256 algorithm (Secure Hash Algorithm):</p>

<pre><code>echo This is a message | sha256sum

6afa89a2ed3ff1f33150c8c897c3c49775b4fb91fa923b790533a0f26c956a88

# Notice that a single letter difference completely changes the output
echo This is b message | sha256sum

0c9bf9d4f05d174783676acbdd50ffde59bffa5f17eaf0557500c3070678ff5b
</code></pre>

<p>Hashes are very useful. They are often used as checksums to ensure that a message was transferred without getting corrupted. For example, a website offering a download may also list its hash. After the user downloads the file, they can recalculate the hash. If their result matches the website&rsquo;s listing, they can be assured that they have the exact same file that the website served; there was no corruption during the download.</p>

<p>Hashes are also used to hide passwords. When you sign up for a website and enter a password, the website will take the hash of your password and store the hash. Later on when you want to log in, you enter your password again. The website takes the hash again and compares it to their stored hash. If the two hashes match, you are allowed to log in. If the website gets hacked and their database of hashes is retrieved, the attacker cannot get your password (because hashes cannot be reversed).</p>

<p>It is important to choose a strong password, however. Attackers can still attempt to retrieve your password by performing a dictionary attack. An attacker will take a large dictionary of words and calculate their hashes. They then compare their list of hashes to the list of hashes retrieved from the website. If they find a match, they can look back at their input list to determine which word produced the hash. This is a brute force method for obtaining your password. It is important to see that it isn&rsquo;t that the hash was reversed, rather that multiple inputs were tried until the desired output was found. There are protections against this type of attack, such as salting, but that is out of the scope of this primer.</p>

<h2>Digital Signatures</h2>

<p>Now, back to our previous question; How can Bob be assured that a message came from Alice? Because of the way asymmetric encryption works, Alice can also encrypt a message using her own private key. The resulting cyphertext can be decrypted by anyone, since the corresponding public key is publicly available. However, the cyphertext could only have been created by Alice, because she is the only one who has the private key. This is called a digital signature; Alice <em>signs</em> a message by encrypting it with her private key.</p>

<p>Because asymmetric encryption keys are so large (which causes the resulting cyphertext to be large), it is not practical to encrypt an entire message, especially if that message is large. Instead, the hash of the message is encrypted, and the message itself is sent in plaintext (unencrypted). Anyone can read the message and compute it&rsquo;s hash. Then, they use Alice&rsquo;s public key to decrypt the signature connected to the message to obtain the hash that Alice encrypted. If the two hashes match, then the message was not tampered with, and the user can be certain that the message originated from Alice.</p>

<h2>Secure Communication</h2>

<p>Putting these concepts togther, here is how secure communication can be established:</p>

<p>Alice and Bob each generate asymmetric key pairs. They take a hash of their public key and encrypt it with their private key. They then attach the result to the public key itself. This is called self-signing their public key.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob share their public keys with each other. One of them generates a random session key and encrypts it with their private key. They take the result and encrypt it with the public key of the recipient.</p>

<p>The receiver uses their private key to decrypt the message, and use the sender&rsquo;s public key to decrypt the result to obtain the random session key. The sender is assured that only the intended receiver is able to obtain the key, and the receiver is assured that only the expected sender could have sent it. From here, they can establish a secure channel using symmetric encryption with the session key. Any evesdropper on the exchange would not be able to gain access to the session key, and thus could not listen in on the secure channel.</p>

<p>However, there is still one thing missing which makes this communication vulnerable to a man in the middle attack. If Eve is able to tamper with the initial handshake, where the public keys are exchanged, she could pass fake public keys to each side. Alice would think that she received Bob&rsquo;s public key, when in fact she received Eve&rsquo;s public key. Her entire communication would be with Eve directly, who is impersonating Bob, but is also passing the messages to Bob after reading them. Neither is aware that this is happening.</p>

<p>In other words, you can securely communicate with someone and be assurred that no one else can evesdrop, but you cannot be certain about who you are actually communicating with.</p>

<p>The signatures on the keys don&rsquo;t give any additional information on their own; they only claim that the holder of the private key trusts the public key. The missing piece to the security is linking an identity to the public key, so you know which key belongs to who. Once you can trust that you are securely communicating with the correct person, you win!</p>

<h2>Digital Certificates</h2>

<p>A digital certificate is an identity linked to a public key, and signed by someone trustworthy. An identity in this case can be something as simple as a name or email address, or it can be as complicated as a photo of a license / passport or fingerprints. It is a means of uniquely identifying and verifying an individual or organization.</p>

<p>A digital certificate links an identity to a public key. Certificates can be signed with many different signatures, as well as a self-signature (the owner of the public key). Certificates play an important role in creating a network of trust. Remember, anyone can create an identity and public key, and they can sign their own certificate. This means that while the link between the public key and identity is real, the identity itself could be fabricated. Trust in a certificate is established by obtaining signatures from trustworthy entities.</p>

<p>There are currently two models for establishing trust in digital certificates. One of them is a hierarchial centralized method which uses a <code>root certificate authority</code> that must be completely trusted, while the other is a decentralized <code>web of trust</code> that gives each person full control of their trust.</p>

<h2>Root Certificate Authority</h2>

<p>This is a centralized system that focuses completely around the root authority. The root authority is responsible for performing background checks to verify an identity, and signs off on the certificate if the identity is legitimate. Root authorities can sign the certificates of sub-authorities, which in turn are granted the same responsibilities and signing powers. Anyone can request that an authority sign their certificate, which usually involves payment of a fee, to grant the trust of the root authority to their certificate.</p>

<p>If you can find a chain of signatures from a certificate back to the root authority, and you trust the root authority, then you can trust the certificate. This trust model is all or nothing, meaning that as long as the root authority is trusted, every chain originating at the root authority is trusted regardless of the number of links.</p>

<p>Most of the internet works using this model. Your web browser comes with preinstalled certificates for the major root authorities, which sign the certificates of all the websites you interact with. There are flaws with this model, however. Security is a &ldquo;weakest link&rdquo; type of problem; A chain ending at the root authority doesn&rsquo;t mean that the entire chain is solid. It could be that a sub-authority does not properly perform its background checks, resulting in that sub-authority being the weakest link. If that sub-authority signs a fabricated certificate, there is no way for you to know not to trust it. The owner of the certificate could masquerade as their false identity and impersonate a target.</p>

<p>In addition to this, well funded organizations such as the NSA can take control of a root authority and sign whichever certificates they want, essentially breaking the entire model.</p>

<h2>Web of Trust</h2>

<p>To avoid the single point of failure present in the centralized hierarchial model, a different model known as the <code>web of trust</code> was created. This model is decentralized and gives the control back to the individuals. The web of trust involves each person performing their own level of identity checking before signing off on a certificate. In effect, they become their own root authority for themselves. If you are able to verify an identity one time and sign off on it, you can trust that identity from that point forward. This method involves more manual work, making it a little less convienient. It is also more probabilistic than the black/white hierarchial model, in that trust is measured in the quantity of signatures rather then the presence of a single signature. The upside is that the only single point of failure is yourself, as you get to define the trust levels of each certificate you interact with.</p>

<p>In the web of trust model, you are responsible for verifying that the identity of the certificate matches the identity of the certificate holder. This is typically done in person or over some other medium besides the one being used with the certificate (such as the phone). You would ask the person to present their certificate as well as some reputable identification, such as a passport or drivers license, and sign the certificate if the identities match. Chains are formed transitively by signing a certificate when someone has signed your own certificate.</p>

<p>For example, if Alice signs Bob&rsquo;s certificate, and Bob sign&rsquo;s Carol&rsquo;s certificate, then Alice can reasonably trust that Carol&rsquo;s certificate is authentic. Even though she hasn&rsquo;t necessarily met Carol, Alice trusts that Bob performed the necessary identity checks. Alice&rsquo;s trust in Carol can be increased if there are other chains that linkt he two together. If Alice also signed Dave&rsquo;s certificate, and Dave also signed Carol&rsquo;s certificate, then Carol has two signatures from people that Alice trusts, further increasing the odds that Carol really is who she says she is (from Alice&rsquo;s point of view).</p>

<p>It is important to note that it isn&rsquo;t the number of signatures that determines trust, it is the number of chains. For example, Eve can create 100 fake identites and have them all sign her certificate, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Eve can be trusted.</p>

<p>In this model, each additional link degrades trust; A certificate 2 steps away can typically be trusted more than a certificate 5 steps away. If everyone is creating chains from themselves to everyone else, a web of trust is formed, hence the name.</p>

<h2>Where to next?</h2>

<p>Using the fundamental technologies of modern cryptography, we have learned how to establish secure communications with a trusted identity. How can we apply these techniques in practice? What else can we apply these methods to? Stay tuned, I will cover this and more in a future blog post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I like to do when I&rsquo;m browsing the internet is save each interesting page I come across. I do this by printing the page to a PDF. This is better than saving a bookmark because articles on the internet have a tendency to go down when you need them most. In addition, I use <a href="http://getpocket.com/a/queue/list/">Pocket</a> to save articles while browsing with my phone or work computer, where I cannot print to PDF. It is easy to export your Pocket articles to an HTML file, and it is easy to parse that file to extract the links.</p>

<p>First, we need some things.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby cups-pdf wkhtmltopdf xdg-utils pcmanfm recoll
gem install pdfkit nokogiri
</code></pre>

<p>I use LXDE, and <code>xdg-open</code> forwards requests though <code>pcmanfm</code>, so it needs to be installed. For indexing the PDFs, <code>recoll</code> is very useful and allows for quickly searching for content.</p>

<p>I wrote a small ruby script to take a URL and generate a PDF. It uses PDFKit under the hood, which in turn uses <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> to do the PDF generation. <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> has a tendency to get hung up on some pages, especially if Java is involved, and the normal ruby call to PDFKit will freeze until <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> is killed. I found out the hard way that the standard <code>Timeout</code> module in ruby isn&rsquo;t enough; the <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> process needs to be killed directly. I do this by using a timer thread and a small <code>killall</code> function:</p>

<pre><code># Kill a process by name
def killall(name)

   # For each process
   Dir['/proc/[0-9]*/cmdline'].each do |p|

      # Check to see if the command line invocation matches the given name
      if File.read(p).match name

         # Grab the PID
         pid = p.split('/')[2].to_i

         # Kill the process
         Process.kill("SIGKILL", pid)
      end
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will only work on Linux, since it is crawling the Kernel&rsquo;s <code>proc</code> filesystem.<br/>
With that function available, here is a small PDF generation class as a wrapper around PDFKit:</p>

<pre><code>require 'pdfkit'

# A wrapper around PDFKit that generates PDFs from URLs
# It uses wkhtmltopdf under the hood.
# wkhtmltopdf can sometimes hang, this wrapper takes care of that
# so PDF generation can be autmomated
class PdfGenerator

   def initialize
      PDFKit.configure do |config|
         config.default_options[:load_error_handling] = 'ignore'
         config.default_options[:load_media_error_handling] = 'ignore'
      end
   end

   # Convert a webpage to a PDF file
   # Returns true if successful, false if there was an error or a timeout
   def from_url(url, output_filename)

      retval = true

      # Run the PDF generation in a thread
      # so we can kill it after some amount of time
      process_thread = Thread.new do
         begin
            puts "Processing " + url
            kit = PDFKit.new(url)
            kit.to_file(output_filename)
         rescue
            puts "Failed to process " + url
            retval = false
         end
      end

      # Start a timer to kill the process thread
      # if it takes too long
      timeout_thread = Thread.new do
         sleep 60
         if process_thread.alive?
            killall "wkhtmltopdf"
            process_thread.kill
            puts "Timed out"
            retval = false
         end
      end

      # Wait for the process thread to end
      process_thread.join
      timeout_thread.kill

      if retval
         puts "Successfully processed " + url
      end

      return retval

   end

end
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to parse out the Pocket export file to get the title and links. Here is some code for that:</p>

<pre><code>require 'nokogiri'

# Create a PDF generator
pdf_generator = PdfGenerator.new

# Open the pocket export file
page = Nokogiri::HTML(open("ril_export.html"))

# Parse out the links
links = page.css('a')

# For each link
links.each do |link|

   title = link.text
   url = link['href']

   # Sanitize the title to be a valid filename
   title.gsub!(/[^0-9A-Za-z.\-]/, '_')
   title.downcase!

   # Specify the output filename using the title
   output_filename = title + '.pdf'

   # Skip any files that have already been processed
   if File.exist?(output_filename)
      next
   end

   # Generate the PDF
   result = pdf_generator.from_url(url, output_filename)

end
</code></pre>

<p>The end result will be that all your Pocket articles will be printed to PDF! Very nice and easy to automate.</p>

<p>But what to do with all these PDFs? Recoll is a simple indexer that can quickly search them for the content you are looking for. After a large collection of links have been built up, you will have your own little offline internet database at your fingertips.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a large amount of bookmarks, and I find that even with good organization, I tend to lose them in the bookmark bar. For me it is much easier to find that bookmark I am looking for if I can see a thumbnail of the page. These graphical bookmarks are known as &ldquo;speed dials&rdquo;, and there is a Chrome extension that implements it very well: Speed Dial 2</p>

<p>One of the things I did not like about Speed Dial 2 was manually entering each bookmark, then selecting a thumbnail for it. The import / export format was very confusing to figure out, and I decided that automating the whole thing would be a big timesaver in the end. So I wrote a Ruby script to do just that.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Chrome / Chromium</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Speed Dial 2 extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-dial-2/jpfpebmajhhopeonhlcgidhclcccjcik">here</a></li>
<li>Speed Dial conversion script <a href="https://github.com/jrruethe/speeddial">here</a></li>
<li>A bookmarks.yml file, as described below</li>
</ul>


<p>The format of the file is pretty simple. There can be multiple groups that represent tabs on the Chrome home screen. Each group can have multiple bookmarks that represent dials on the home screen. The dial thumbnail will be automatically generated from a screenshot of that URL, but it can be manually changed later. It should be noted that whichever group appears first in the file will be the default group that is selected when a new Chrome home page is opened.</p>

<pre><code>---
Group:
 - Title : URL
 - Title : URL
...
</code></pre>

<p>Included in the repository is my bookmarks.yml file, which includes multiple useful bookmarks for various tasks.</p>

<h2>Put it all together</h2>

<p>Run the conversion script:</p>

<pre><code>./speeddial.rb --input bookmarks.yml --output bookmarks.json
</code></pre>

<p>On the Chrome home page, which is now Speed Dial 2, select Options &ndash;> More Options &ndash;> Import / Export &ndash;> Import Settings. Copy the contents of <code>bookmarks.json</code> and paste it into the box. Click &ldquo;Import these settings&rdquo; and save. The initial load will take a moment, and you will see an error like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Something unexpected happened: could not execute statement due to a constraint failure (19 constraint failed)
</code></pre>

<p>The error can be safely ignored (it may appear a few times). Once the initial load is complete (you may need to refresh), subsequent loads will be much faster, and will not throw errors.</p>

<p>Sometimes the thumbnails are not generated correctly. For those, you can simply right click and edit to change the thumbnail. If you see &ldquo;Generating thumbnail&hellip;&rdquo;, then simply refresh the screen at a later time. The thumbnail generation is done using a third-party web service, which queues up requests, so thumbnails should appear at a later time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the following Github repository you will find a ruby script to produce enhanced corefile metadata upon a core dump. <br/>
It hooks into the kernel&rsquo;s corepattern mechanism to accept the core dump via stdin and extract information from the process before it is killed. It then runs GDB to produce a backtrace and grab the register contents.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jrruethe/corefile">Enhanced Corefile Metadata</a></p>

<p>Here is a list of metadata that is written out on every core dump:</p>

<ul>
<li>Binary that crashed</li>
<li>Corefile from the crash</li>
<li>Signal causing the crash</li>
<li>Original filepath</li>
<li>Original file size</li>
<li>MD5 checksum of the binary</li>
<li>MD5 checksum of the corefile</li>
<li>Creation, modification, and access times of the binary</li>
<li>Hostname and PID of the crashed process</li>
<li>User, group, and permissions of the crashed process</li>
<li>The setuid bit</li>
<li>Working directory of the process</li>
<li>Invoked command line parameters</li>
<li>Stack trace</li>
<li>Memory Map</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>Frame information</li>
<li>Register states</li>
</ul>


<p>This script is very useful for bug reports as well as devloping buffer overflow exploits.
To install, save <code>corefile.rb</code> somewhere. Edit <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and set the <code>kernel.core_pattern</code> parameter as follows:</p>

<pre><code>kernel.core_pattern=|/path/to/corefile.rb %e %p %u %g %h %s
</code></pre>

<p><em>Take note of the pipe character!</em></p>

<p>If you want to test it out, simply crash something.<br/>
Make sure you use <code>ulimit -c unlimited</code> or have corefiles enabled in <code>sysctl.conf</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bittorrent Sync is an awesome folder synchronization tool that uses the Bittorrent protocol. It is simple and fast alternative to Dropbox. Best of all, the files are only ever stored on machines <em>you</em> choose; there is no &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; or third party servers.</p>

<p>I use Bittorrent Sync to keep all my machines up to date with eachother, share files, and perform backups. It works on Windows, Linux, and Android. Unfortunately, it is not open source, however I am still a fan of this software.</p>

<p>There is no official installer for Bittorrent Sync on Debian, but the steps to get it working are pretty simple.<br/>
First you need to go get the software:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/downloads/complete/os/i386">32 Bit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/downloads/complete/os/x64">64 Bit</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I suggest unpacking it to /opt/btsync:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /opt/btsync
mv btsync_x64.tar.gz /opt/btsync
cd /opt/btsync
tar xzvf ./btsync_x64.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Next, create a configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>./btsync --dump-sample-config &gt; btsync.conf
</code></pre>

<p>You need to make one change to the config file, and that is the storage path.<br/>
Look for where it says <code>/home/user/.sync</code> and change <code>user</code> to your username.<br/>
You might be interested in adding a password to the Web UI, which is where you will do all your folder management from. You can find thhat setting near the bottom of the config file.</p>

<p>Next, you want to create an init script. Copy the following to <code>/etc/init.d/btsync</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/sh
# /etc/init.d/btsync
#

# Carry out specific functions when asked to by the system
case "$1" in
start)
    # /opt/btsync/btsync --config /opt/btsync/btsync.conf # Run as root
    /bin/su user -c '/opt/btsync/btsync --config /opt/btsync/btsync.conf' # Run as user
    ;;
stop)
    killall btsync
    ;;
*)
    echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/btsync {start|stop}"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, run the following commands to finish the installation:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 755 /etc/init.d/btsync
update-rc.d btsync defaults
mkdir ~/.sync
/etc/init.d/btsync start
</code></pre>

<p>Thats it! Bittorrent Sync is installed, and will automatically run every time your machine boots.<br/>
You can access the Web UI at 127.0.0.1:8888</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is just a little trick to get the ability to open a Terminator terminal at any location from Nautilus by right clicking on a folder.</p>

<p>First install the dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal terminator
</code></pre>

<p>Next, <em>uninstall</em> <code>gnome-terminal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove gnome-terminal
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, create a symlink to <code>terminator</code> from <code>gnome-terminal</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/terminator /usr/bin/gnome-terminal
</code></pre>

<p>All done! Now you can right click on any folder in Nautilus and open a terminator window.<br/>
The reason the symlink is needed is because <code>nautilus-open-terminal</code> is hardcoded to use <code>gnome-terminal</code> by default, but <code>terminator</code> is much better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Starting Fresh</h3>

<p>Use these instructions if you are creating a blog for the first time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install dependencies</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby bundler rake git  
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress  
cd octopress  
bundle install  
rake install  
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create the Github repository</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/repositories/new">Github</a>, create a new repository of the format <code>username.github.io</code></p></li>
<li><p>Set up deployment to Github Pages</p>

<pre><code>rake setup_github_pages
rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Commit the source</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m 'your message'
git push origin source
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add some customizations</p>

<p>I personally use the following third party plugins:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/octopress-bitcoin-donation-aside">Bitcoin</a> : Add a QR code for Bitcoin Donations</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aycabta/octopress-file-binder">File Binder</a> : Easily attach an image to a post</li>

<li>Disqus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Set up Github Pages</p>

<pre><code>rake _0.9.2.2_ setup_github_pages
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>Ready to go. Jump down to &ldquo;Creating a post&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<h3>Continuing from an existing repository</h3>

<p>Use these instructions if you are continuing a blog that has already been created.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install the dependencies</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby bundler rake git 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Clone the repository</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install the octopress dependencies</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Ready to go. Jump down to &ldquo;Creating a post&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>


<hr />

<h3>Creating a post</h3>

<p>You may have a newer <code>rake</code> installed on your machine. Octopress requires version 0.9.2.2, so we need to make sure we use that version.</p>

<pre><code>alias rake="rake _0.9.2.2_"
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create a new post:</p>

<pre><code>rake new_post["title"]
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can preview your work:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake preview
</code></pre>

<p>Open your browser to <code>127.0.0.1:4000</code> and make sure your page looks the way you want.<br/>
To finalize your changes:</p>

<pre><code>git add source/_posts/date-title.markdown
git commit -m 'Message'
git push origin source
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you want to make sure that you re-pull after the deployment is complete, or you will run into problems when creating your next post:</p>

<pre><code>git pull
cd _deploy/
git pull
cd -
</code></pre>

<p>Go to <code>username.github.com</code> and check out your page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of the features of the Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga work out of the box with a fresh install of Debian Testing.
Keep in mind that I am using Kernel 3.14.1-amd64</p>

<h3>Wireless</h3>

<p>Wireless does work well, but you need to install the firmware package from the repositories.</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi
</code></pre>

<p>Getting this was tricky, because there are no ethernet ports on the system, and the wireless is not recognised at install time.<br/>
I had to use a usb-ethernet adapter and plug it into my router.<br/>
After installing the package and rebooting, wireless works great.</p>

<h3>Touchscreen</h3>

<p>Touchscreen works out of the box for left clicking and dragging.<br/>
Multitouch does not seem to work out of the box, I am unable to two-finger-scroll nor pinch-zoom in Chromium.
Also, holding down your finger for right click does not work.</p>

<h3>Wacom Stylus</h3>

<p>The stylus works out of the box, including clicking and dragging. There is a little button on the stylus, and if you hold it down while you touch the screen it does a right-click.<br/>
By installing <code>gnome-control-center</code> you can calibrate the touchscreen with the stylus.</p>

<h3>Touchpad</h3>

<p>The Synaptics Touchpad works out of the box for the most part. However, tap-to-click doesn&rsquo;t work.
Clicking the entire touchpad down with one finger is a left-click, while clicking the entire touchpad down with two fingers is a right click.<br/>
Dragging while holding the touchpad down works for multiple selection and moving files around.<br/>
Two-finger scroll works out of the box.<br/>
I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to do a middle-click.</p>

<p>I tried using <code>gnome-control-center</code> to enable tap-to-click, but was unsuccessful. I don&rsquo;t think the lack of this feature hinders usability in any way.</p>

<p>Also, the little red pointer nub works as well. You need to click the touchpad with your thumb, and there is no real way to do a right click while using the red pointer nub.</p>

<h3>Sound</h3>

<p>Sound works out of the box, however it is muted at installation.<br/>
I found the easiest way to fix this is to install PulseAudio Volume Control (<code>pavucontrol</code>) and unmute the speakers.</p>

<h3>Bluetooth</h3>

<p>Bluetooth seemed to work out of the box as well. I did install the <code>bluetooth</code> and <code>blueman</code> packages to use it.</p>

<h3>Webcam</h3>

<p>The webcam works out of the box.</p>

<h3>Function Keys</h3>

<p>The brightness keys (F5 / F6) work out of the box, but there is no OSD / HUD.<br/>
The wireless key (F8) also works without any configuration needed.</p>

<p>The webcam buttom (F7) seems to work, but there is a caveat:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start webcam with QtQr</li>
<li>See webcam active</li>
<li>Press F7</li>
<li>See webcam get immediately disabled</li>
<li>Without pressing F7 again, start the webcam</li>
<li>The webcam is active again</li>
