### [WalletGenerator.net]() ([Github]())

{% img center ./02.png %}

This is a simpler paper wallet that doesn't require any cuts or stickers. 
It can be quickly printed and folded up on short notice, and is good for giving a small amount of Bitcoin to someone who doesn't have a smart phone or a Bitcoin app. 
It is not as secure, but is more practical and convenient.
